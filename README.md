# FriendFinder

# About
Friend Finder is an app that matches users up with a friend that will be highly compatible with them, based on basic personality questions.

# How to Use
When User(you) get to the homepage, there is a button to take you to a ten statement survey. For each statement, User can select how much they agree or disagree on a scale of 1-5. After they click submit, they will see a pop-up with their highest match's name and picture displayed.

# How it Works
The home page simply has a button to take the user to the survey. When the user takes the survey, the value of their answers is saved to their name, then compared to the answers of other users. For each comparison, the absolute value of the difference is taken and eventually all ten absolute values are added together. The user match is whomever has the lowest score, as they have the least differences with the User.
